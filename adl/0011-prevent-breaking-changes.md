## ðŸ“‹ Context and Problem Statement
> **How should we handle API contract breaking changes?**

By versioning our routes (`host/api/v1/route`, `host/api/v2/route`, etc). Our consumers should _never_ have OK calls that become KO a day later.

## ðŸ’¡ Considered Options
* _Option 1: We don't._
    * âœ… Zero effort
    * ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš« API consumers have no confidence in their calls to our API
* **_Option 2: Version our API routes._**
    * âœ… API consumers have confidence in their calls to our API
