## ðŸ“‹ Context and Problem Statement
> **How do we write access modifiers for types and type members?**

By taking advantage of default access modifiers:
* Types (`class`, `struct`, `record`) are encapsulated at the assembly level by default (`internal`)
* Types members (`methods`, `properties`, `fields`) are encapsulated at the type level by default (`private`)
* Only a few `public` and `internal` keywords should be written in the files - and occasionally some `private`

## ðŸ’¡ Considered Options
* _Option 1: by expliciting every access modifiers (private, internal, public)_
  * âœ… It is explicit
  * ðŸš« Not taking advantage of default access modifiers
* **_Option 2: by taking advantage of default access modifiers_**
  * ðŸš« It requires knowledge of the default access modifiers
  * âœ… Source code is less verbose
  * âœ…âœ… Creates a mindset where normality is encapsulation and only transparent access is specified
