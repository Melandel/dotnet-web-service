## ðŸ“‹ Context and Problem Statement
> **How should we detect errors?**

Verify constraints when instantiating any object (using exceptions)

## ðŸ’¡ Considered Options
* _Option 1: Zero effort._
    * âœ… Zero effort
    * ðŸš« Errors may be detected very late/never
    * ðŸš«ðŸš« High investigation cost when the actual behavior is not expected
* _Option 2: Apply guard clauses at the beginning of each method._
    * âœ… Impact caused by errors is mitigated to some extent
    * ðŸš« Some verifications may be implemented several times
* **_Option 3: Verify constraints when instantiating any object (using exceptions)._**
    * âœ… Impact caused by errors is mitigated to some extent
    * âœ…âœ… Verifications are mutualized
    * âœ…âœ… Impossible for an invalid object instance to exist
    * âœ…âœ… Reusing existing objects is highly encouraged
    * ðŸš« Exceptions disrupt the execution path and are expensive in terms of performance
* _Option 4: Verify constraints when instantiating any object (using Result<Value, Error> pattern)._
    * âœ… Impact caused by errors is mitigated to some extent
    * âœ…âœ… Verifications are mutualized
    * âœ…âœ… Impossible for an invalid object instance to exist
    * âœ…âœ… Reusing existing objects is highly encouraged
    * âœ… Errors do not disrupt the execution path
    * ðŸš«ðŸš« There is a big risk of either inconsistency in the use of the `Result<Value, Error>` pattern, either it will be used everywhere (can be expensive for both the writer & the reader)
