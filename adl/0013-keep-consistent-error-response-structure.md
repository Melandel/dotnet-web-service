## ðŸ“‹ Context and Problem Statement
> **How should we handle errors?**

By following the [RFC 9457][rfcAboutHttpApisErrorHanding] and its associated [ProblemDetails][problemdetails] data structure:
```json
{
  "type": "A URI reference [RFC3986] that identifies the problem type.
    This specification encourages that, when dereferenced, it provide human-readable documentation for the problem type (e.g., using HTML [W3C.REC-html5-20141028]).
    When this member is not present, its value is assumed to be ""about:blank"".Consumers MUST use the ""type"" string as the primary identifier for the problem type; the ""title"" string is advisory and included only for users who are not aware of the semantics of the URI and do not have the ability to discover them (e.g., offline log analysis).
    Consumers SHOULD NOT automatically dereference the type URI.",
  "title": "A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
    It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization (e.g., using proactive content negotiation; see [RFC7231], Section 3.4).
    Consumers MUST use the ""type"" string as the primary identifier for the problem type; the ""title"" string is advisory and included only for users who are not aware of the semantics of the URI and do not have the ability to discover them (e.g., offline log analysis).
    Consumers SHOULD NOT automatically dereference the type URI.",
  // The HTTP status code ([RFC7231], Section 6) generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
  // The "status" member, if present, is only advisory; it conveys the HTTP status code used for the convenience of the consumer.
  "status": 500,
  "detail": "A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.
    The ""detail"" member, if present, ought to focus on helping the client correct the problem, rather than giving debugging information.
    Consumers SHOULD NOT parse the ""detail"" member for information; extensions are more suitable and less error-prone ways to obtain such information.",
  "instance": "A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.
    It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.",

  // Examples of extensions
  // ======================
  // the key should be a word that is an extension of the problem

  // Example 1: a "out of credit" problem may define a "balance" extension and a "accounts" extension
  "balance": 30,
  "accounts": ["/account/12345", "/account/67890"],

  // Example 2: a "validation" problem may define a "balance" extension and a "invalid-params" extension
  "invalid-params": [
    { "name": "age",   "reason": "must be a positive integer" },
    { "name": "color", "reason": "must be 'green', 'red' or 'blue'"}
  ]
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ Considered Options
* _Option 1: Zero effort._
    * âœ… It works
    * âœ… It is simple
    * ðŸš« It generates more work than needed whenever an error happens
* _Option 2: Create a custom policy._
    * âœ… It works
    * âœ… It is ad-hock
    * ðŸš« We may be reinventing the wheel
    * ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš« We want something homogeneous throughout all our applications
* _Option 3: Use the [RFC 9457][rfcAboutHttpApisErrorHanding] standard._
    * âœ… aspnetcore already supports it
    * âœ…âœ… it is a global standard so it's easier to use it throughout all our applications
