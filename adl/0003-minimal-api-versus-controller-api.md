## ðŸ“‹ Context and Problem Statement
> **Which ASP.NET Web API style should we use? Minimal API or Controller API (aka MVC API)?**

We'll use `Controller APIs` for safety (tried-and-tested set of features):
```text
dotnet new webapi
```

## ðŸ’¡ Considered Options
* _Option 1: Use `Minimal`-style Web API (`dotnet new `)_
    * âœ… It works
    * âœ… It is simple
    * ðŸš« Set of available features is tiny but growing
* **_Option 2: Use `Controller`-style (aka `MVC`-style) Web API_**
    * âœ… It works
    * âœ… It is simple
    * âœ… It has a lot of out-of-the-box features
