## 📋 Context and Problem Statement
> **Which ASP.NET Web API style should we use? Minimal API or Controller API (aka MVC API)?**

We'll use `Controller APIs` for safety (tried-and-tested set of features):
```text
dotnet new webapi
```

## 💡 Considered Options
* _Option 1: Use `Minimal`-style Web API (`dotnet new `)_
    * ✅ It works
    * ✅ It is simple
    * 🚫 Set of available features is tiny but growing
* **_Option 2: Use `Controller`-style (aka `MVC`-style) Web API_**
    * ✅ It works
    * ✅ It is simple
    * ✅ It has a lot of out-of-the-box features
