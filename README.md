## What is dotnet-web-service?
`dotnet-web-service` is a git repository hosting the implementation of a web service using `ASP.NET`.

This web service returns a greeting message directed at more-or-less random people.

## What is dotnet-web-service for?
As an aspiring software craftsmanship, I try to raise the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.

Through this work I have come to develop an opinionated vision of what the word `clean` represents to _me_ - also, I do understand that my preferences are _personal and subjective to my own system of values_.

This repository serves as a tangible representation of my current position on my software craftsmanship journey.

## What problem(s) does dotnet-web-service solve?
### 1) Reusing keystrokes
* Software developers across all teams have different systems of value and different levels of knowledge.
* As I come across more and more in my career, I often end up making the same decisions and having to explain them over and over again.
* **Writing down decisions and providing explanations on a public document may sometimes help me reuse some common arguments.**

### 2) Providing a proof-of-concept
* There are a lot, and I mean _a lot_, of aspects to a clean software.
* To name a few: `versioning policy`, `error handling policy`, `testing strategy`, `logging policy`, `living documentation`, `performances`, `expressiveness`, `ability to evolve easily`.
* **With so many aspects entangled in the final implementation, having a proof-of-concept close at hand becomes handy for maturing & sharing ideas.**

### 3) Bootstrapping consistent projects with consistent nice-to-have policies
* `nice-to-have policies` are aspects of clean software that are _highly_ valuable yet _not_ prioritized at the beginning of most projects: `versioning`, `documentation`, `error handling`, etc.
* In my experience, `Consistency` never matters in the present moment, but after months or years, it becomes a requirement because of source code accumulation.
* **A base implementation with `nice-to-have policies` and `consistency` aspects already covered in _some_ way, prevents them from being neglected entirely in the future.**
